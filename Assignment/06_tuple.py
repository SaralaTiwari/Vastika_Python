Tuple Exercises

Please read the note carefully and try to solve the problem below:

"""

"""
1. Write a program to create a tuple to  add 5 different numbers.
    a. find out the length of the tuple
    b. find out the 3rd element of the tuple by accessing it through the index
    c. use `enumerate()` function to map each element with its index and print it using the foreach loop
        - please see the reference to the file 02_data_types/06_tuples.py

"""
# answer 1
#%% Creating a list with 5 element and changing it to the tuple using consle input.
list_1 = []
while(list_1.__len__()) <= 6:
    x = input('Enter the element :')
    list_1.append(x)
    print(f'More element please! This is/are your enterred elements so far: {list_1}')
    if (list_1.__len__()) == 5:
        tuple_1 = tuple(list_1)
        print(f'This is your 5 element tuple : {tuple_1} ')
        break
    

# %% Finding length of the tuple.

# a
p = tuple_1.__len__()
print(f'Length of the tuple is : {p}')

#%% Finding third elements of the tuple.
# b
print (f'Third element of the tuple is: ', tuple_1[2])

#%% Demonstrating enumarate function.
# c
enum = enumerate(tuple_1)
print('Here is the pair of index and element of the tuple-')
for (index, number) in enum:
    print(f'{index} - {number}')

2. Write a program to create a nested tuple and access different elements of the inner tuple using
   positive and negative index positions.

-Create a for loop which can go n number 
-n is list number
-Turn each list ot the tuple
-merge or combined  n number of tuple in a single tuple
-Access elements of that nested tuple with various way.

3. create two different tuples t1 and t2 with different elements inside it
    a. create the next tuple t3 to add all values of t1 and t2 using the destructuring method

    - and t2 has (2,7,8,3,5)
    -t3 must have (1,6,9,4,3,2,7,8,3,5)

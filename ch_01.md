# Chapter 1: Python Basics


## What is python?

- An interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language
- Created by _Guido Van Rossum_, First released in 1991
- It can be used in:
  - Software and Web Development
  - Mathematics, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
  - Games and Simulation
  - Scripting


## What is an interpreter

- A computer program that directly executes instructions without    requiring to be compiled to a machine level code.
- The code executes line-by-line when required
- Unlike compiler, it runs instructions until the line where error is spotted
- It does not generate intermediary code, hence, is highly efficient in terms of memory
- Drawback: Needs to be interpreted every time
- Programming languages such as Perl, Python, MATLAB, QBasic are interpreted programming languages


## Features of python

### Python is easy to code
Python syntax is too easy and the code is so cleaner that anyone (even non-programmers understand python code easily)

Hello world program in **C++** and **Java** vs **Python**

**C++**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
**Java**
```java
// Java code
class Main{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Hello World!")
    }
}
```

**Python**
```python
print('Hello World!')
```

### Among programming languages, Python grammar is closest to English grammar.

Example: Checking if a string is in an array/list of strings
**C++**
```cpp
bool in_array(const std::string &value, const std::vector<std::string> &array)
{
    return std::find(array.begin(), array.end(), value) != array.end();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> tab {"Jon", "Jane"};

    if (in_array(n, tab)) {
        cout << "The name is probably a placeholder"
    }
}
```
**python**
```python
if name in ['Jon', 'Jane']:
    print("The name is probably a placeholder")
```

other examples in python
```python
# checking if condition is true or not
if condition is not this_value:
    do_this_task()

value = 'Even' if x%2==0 else 'Odd'
```

### Some notable features of python for programmers coming from other programming languages

Unlike other programming languages, python do not need to end the statement with semicolons.
- When we insert a new line, python automatically identifies whether statement is complete or not.
- If the brackets are open, it do not terminate the statement with new line.

```python
x = 5     # terminates the statement

person = {                  # does not terminate the statement
    'name': 'Jon Doe'
}                           # statement will be terminated here
```

Python do not need curly brackets or braces to identify a block of code however *indentation* is used.
- standard indentation type in python is space however tab character in modern IDEs and code editors are automatically converted into spaces by default.
- standard indentation size is 4.
```python
for value in range(1,10):
    print(f"I am inside the loop and the value is {value}")

print('I am outside the loop now'
```

We can use single or double quotation marks for strings.
- we can even use one kind of quotation mark inside another without escaping the character.
- however using similar kind of quotation inside a string requires escaping the character
-
```python
print("I'm Jon Doe.")
print('He said, "I\'m Jon Doe".')
```

- Python variables are dynamically typed
  - Unlike other statically typed languages, we do not need to specify the data type in python.
```python
x = 5       # it automatically assigns data type as int
y = 5.5     # it automatically assigns data type as float

x = "Jon"   # it replaces the type of data to string from int (previously defined: x = 5).
```

## Why we choose python?
- Compatible with all major operating systems
- Larger community support â–° Easier Syntax, cleaner code, shorter instructions
- Can be used in both procedural and Object-Oriented approach
- Easier to develop, maintain and support


## Installing Python

### Windows
Installing python in windows is so easy. You can just browse https://python.org and download the latest/stable version of your choice and follow the instructions.

> Note: It is recommended to **add python to path** while installing.

## Linux and Mac OS
Linux and Mac os comes with python pre-installed so we do not need to download the one. If we want to install the latest version, then we can follow instructions from https://python.org
